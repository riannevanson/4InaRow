# 4 in a row game made out of a 

Tic Tac Toe front end template

This is the frontend for the game starter in which you can play 4in a row with a friend. It's build using the standard `create-react-app` so the usual `yarn start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly.
